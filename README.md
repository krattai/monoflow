A monolithic flow based programming application

FBP is "a programming paradigm that defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data across predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified externally to the processes."

We have examined some 3D applications for IDE use: Possible 3DE application

This is the github version of the sourceforge project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/monoflow/

Why "MonoFlow"?

For all intents and purposes, the application / environment is intended to be fully extensible. In the same way that GNU/Linux is monolithic and extensible. I intend it to comprise specifically of a stub (to start and stop the primary application) as a "kernel equivalent" and will wrap around the developer environment as an IDE / interpreter (in the same manner as a shell) for the time being.
