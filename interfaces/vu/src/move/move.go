// Move is a real-time simulation of real-world physics.  Move deals with
// automatically applying simulated forces to virtual 3D objects known as bodies.
// Move updates all bodies locations and directions based on forces and collisions
// with other bodies.
//
// Bodies are created using NewBody(shape). For example:
//    box    := NewBody(NewBox(hx, hy, hz))
//    sphere := NewBody(NewSphere(radius))
// Creating and tracking bodies is the responsibility of the calling application.
// Bodies are moved by regularly calling Mover.Step(). Regulating the calls
// to Step() is the responsibility of the calling application. See:
//     http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep
// Once Step has completed, all bodies new locations and directions are stored
// in body.World.
//
// Package move is provided as part of the vu (virtual universe) 3D engine.
