monoflow interface / IDE reference code
====================

The code in the interfaces directory is not technically part of monoflow and may eventually have a project of its own.

Monoflow is a CLI based system, but it would be nice to have interfaces or IDEs that interact with monoflow, allowing easier system design and management.

Two specific folders in the interfaces folder, are Dia and Vu.  Dia being reference code for a possible 2DE (2 dimensional / planer idEnvironment) and Vu, which is a possible 3DE.
