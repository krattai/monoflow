# 
# No modifications of this Makefile should be necessary.
#
# This file contains the build instructions for installing OMF files.  It is
# generally called from the makefiles for particular formats of documentation.
#
# Note that you must configure your package with --localstatedir=/var
# so that the scrollkeeper-update command below will update the database
# in the standard scrollkeeper directory.
#
# If it is impossible to configure with --localstatedir=/var, then
# modify the definition of scrollkeeper_localstate_dir so that
# it points to the correct location. Note that you must still use 
# $(localstatedir) in this or when people build RPMs it will update
# the real database on their system instead of the one under RPM_BUILD_ROOT.
#
# Note: This make file is not incorporated into xmldocs.make because, in
#       general, there will be other documents install besides XML documents
#       and the makefiles for these formats should also include this file.
#
# About this file:
#       This file was derived from scrollkeeper_example2, a package
#       illustrating how to install documentation and OMF files for use with
#       ScrollKeeper 0.3.x and 0.4.x.  For more information, see:
#	       http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net/    
#       Version: 0.1.3 (last updated: March 20, 2002)
