Unfortunately libEMF ( http://libemf.sf.net ) appears to be unmaintained.

While porting from win32/GDI was quite easy there are something lacking:

missing:
	GetACP() // also not in headers
	GetVersion()
	IntersectClipRect()
	TextOutW()
	RoundedRect()
	Pie()
	CreateCompatibleDC()
probably:
	CreateDIBSection()

CreateEnhMetaFile (,filename, ...) did not create the file as advertized.
Using CreateEnhMetaFileWithFILEA() did work without any other code changes.
