Project numbers will currently be displayed as 0000->XX, they will be stored
	as (example) 000110, new updated will change their version number and
	will ship as a different product number.  Costs will be stored seperately
	but will be displayed as a single project for now.
	eg.		project #XXXX			Version X.X
			etc...

Project Tracker also to contain:
	- Project Revenue Distribution
	- information from sales -> distribution process -> direct cost payment
													 -> wage payment -> H.R.
													 \> profit (spin off)
	\> this program is an "information filter"
	- process:
		read sales record
		if company product
			find appropriate project
			if revenue + total revenue > total expense
				if total revenue > total expense
					apply to wages(revenue)
				else
					apply to wages(revenue + total revenue - total expense)
			total revenue += revenue
		repeat from top until EOF

	- when viewing a project or set of projects:
		- profit will be shown by acquiring and calculating:
			total revenue - total expense = profit

	Project Revenue/Expense File:
		Project number, total revenue, total expense

	Special Projects Wages File
		Employee number
		Amount owed
	- if employee in file, add to amount owed
	- if employee not in file, add employee number and amount owed
	- if employee paid, remove employee from file
