Make a command line "operating system" that is actually just an environment
that looks and acts like DOS but is just easier to use.

It should contain the standard commands but will include switches that
are currently unavailable under DOS.

It may then learn...  ie. if you tell it to do something that it doesn't know
how to do or doesn't understand, it will allow you to define the process
and will ever after "know" what you mean.
