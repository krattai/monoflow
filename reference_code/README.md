flosh reference code
====================

The content in the inhouse and software folders are all old code that was written between 1990 - 1995, I believe, some is code I brought forward pre-1990 and copyright dated it when certain, specific code was to be used commercially.  Some of it is specific to kernels and shells, and other is old low level code, including register manipulation.

Some code may actually be useful and relevent for the flosh project, others may just be entertainment fodder for those browsing the project.  :)

Don't laugh, I hadn't heard of that Linux thing, yet...  Linus who??!
